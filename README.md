### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nicola

I am a passionate about the entire software life cycle, who mainly focuses on
- tests

Currently, I am working on scalable architectures, microservices, and event-driven architectures. I believe teamwork is an excellent opportunity for individual and professional growth as it allows for a constant constructive dialogue between parties.
