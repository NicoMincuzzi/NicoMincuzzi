I'm Nicola, a backend developer with expertise in object-oriented programming (OOP) and Java. I'm passionate about creating efficient and reliable software that meets the needs of users.

As a backend developer, I primarily focus on the server-side of applications, building APIs and microservices that power the frontend. I enjoy working with OOP principles as they allow me to write clean and maintainable code that is easy to understand and modify. My preferred programming language is Java, which I believe is a powerful language for building robust and scalable software.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch with me if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks for visiting!
